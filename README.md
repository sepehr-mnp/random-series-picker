hi dear uses!<br>
if you are one of those people that would pick a snack and sit behind their computer to watch a random episode of their favorite episode such as Friends, HIMYM, TBBT and... randopener is here for YOU!<br>
at first i made this simple app just to test the packages that convert .py to .exe but i found it to be really useful for myself so i thought it would be awesome if others used it as well.

# how to use
1- copy the app in your series folder<br>
2- open the app<br>

    -if you want to choose another file(episode) from another folder(season), press "a" again and again until you find your suitable file<br>
    -if you like ani=other file(episode) in the current folder(season) that app have picked file(episode) from, simply just press "n" as many times as you want until you find the one that you like<br><br>
